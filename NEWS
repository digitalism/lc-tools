0.1.5

- Added tool to edit GoGrid images: lc-gg-image-edit.
  Brief info on usage:

      lc-gg-image-edit -i <image_id> -t true \
                -n new_name -d new_descr

  Here, "-t true" tells that given image should be
  public (i.e. visible to all GoGrid users),
  "-n new_name" and "-d new_descr" update image name
  and description respectively.

0.1.4

- Added tools for controlling Rackspace shared
  IP groups: lc-rs-ip-group-list and
  lc-rs-ip-group-do

- Added config file option for SSL certs verification.
  Please add the following to the profile for which
  you want to enabe verification:

     verify_ssl_certs = true

  By default it's disabled.

- Added GoGrid specific script: lc-gg-node-edit
  which allows to change node's amount of RAM
  and description. Sample:

     lc-gg-node-edit -i <node_id> -s <new_size>

- Added ranges support for lc-node-do's -i arg, i.e.
  if previosuly to remove nodes with ids like
  1001, 1002, 1003 you had to issue command like:

     for node in 1001 1002 1003; do \
          lc-node-do -i ${node} destroy; done

  now you just do: lc-node-do -i 1001,1002,1003 destroy
  or even: lc-node-do -i 1001-1003 destroy

- Refuse to work if config file permissons are loose
