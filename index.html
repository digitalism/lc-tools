<h1>about</h1>
<p><tt>lc-tools</tt> is a set of command line tools for
managing clouds. It's based on <a 
         href="http://libcloud.org">libcloud</a> and
therefore supports all the providers that
libcloud supports (EC2, Rackspace and GoGrid
among of them). Like libcloud, it's written in
Python.</p>

<p><tt>lc-tools</tt> allows you to control your servers on the cloud,
i.e. create, update, list, destroy, manage server images, query
account special data like limits, IP addresses and so on. As of version
<tt>0.5.0.0</tt> it supports managing load balancers as well.</p>

<p>Check <a href="/lc-tools/examples.html">examples</a> and then
<a href="/lc-tools/documentation.html">documentation</a> to get a better idea
how <tt>lc-tools</tt> feels like.</p>
